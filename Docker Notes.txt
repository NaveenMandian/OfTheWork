Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. 
The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization. 
Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

^^^ Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:


Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.


^^^^ ##### Image

A container is launched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes 
everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, 
and configuration files. 

^^^^^^ ####### Container

A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed 
(that is, an image with state, or a user process). 
You can see a list of your running containers with the command, docker ps, just as you would in Linux.

docker ps       ## List of running containers

^^^^ ########## Containers and Virtual Machines ###############

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. 
It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access
 to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment
 with more resources than most applications need.
 
^^^^ ####################### About Docker CE :

Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for developers and small teams 
looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps. 
Docker CE has two update channels, stable and edge:

Stable gives you reliable updates every quarter.
Edge gives you new features every month.

^^^ ### Using Docker commands without sudo - add user to a docker group

The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket 
is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. 
The docker daemon always runs as the root user.
If you don’t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, 
create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the docker daemon starts, 
it makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group.

^ Create the docker group.
$ sudo groupadd docker

^ Add your user to the docker group
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

^ Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

^ Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo
$ docker run hello-world

#####
docker run hello-world  # Verify

docker image ls    # List the images

docker container ls --all      # will list even the containers which are exited.

All these changes have always been about Speed,
Speed of Deployment, Speed of Business, Speed of doing things, Develop faster.

Containers are consistent across OS, are packaged the same way.


Maintenance and Complexity drains budget, So Innovation suffers.
80% - Maintenance

Installing Docker on Linux :
Actually there are 3 ways to install

1. Through Script.

curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

---- store.docker.com has instructions for each distro

mainly it comes down to debian based distro and Fedora | Red_Hat based distro.
i.e, YUM package manager and APT package manager.( they cover 95% of use cases in Linux)

RHEL officially only supports Docker EE(paid) | But CentOS will work.
 --- May not work for unlisted distros - such as Amazon Linux, Linode Linux, etc 
 
 --- Recommendation : Don't use pre-installed setups such as Digital Ocean, Linode, etc.
 
 
Docker Linux Setup :

1. First update the package manager and Install Docker

2. add your user to docker group, so that sudo is not required.

Latest Edge release --

1. $ curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
2. $ sh get-docker.sh


sudo usermod -aG docker bret         --- no need to use sudo for docker commands
FYI : But this does not work on RHEL, CentOS, Fedora


####
Then you have to install Docker Machine and Docker Compose, in Windows and Mac it takes care by itself, but in Linux 
you have get yours hands little dirty.

Each one is a single binary, you can get it on Docker Documentation.

$ docker-machine version

$ docker-compose version
