Distributed tracing is a technique for monitoring and profiling systems built on microservices architecture, 
popularized by such systems as X-Trace, Google’s Dapper and Twitter’s Zipkin, OpenTracing.

Jaeger - a Distributed Tracing System. Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies.

Key Takeaways :

Distributing tracing is increasingly seen as an essential component for observing distributed systems and 
microservice applications. There are several popular open source standards and frameworks like the OpenTracing API and OpenZipkin

The basic idea behind distributed tracing is relatively straightforward -- specific request inflexion points 
must be identified within a system and instrumented. All of the trace data must be coordinated and collated to provide a meaningflow view of a request

Request tracing is similar in concept to Application Performance Management (APM), and an emerging challenge 
within both ecosystems is processing the volume of the data generated from increasingly large-scale systems

Google overcame this issue when implementing their Dapper distributed tracing system by sampling traces, 
typically 1 in 1000, but modern commercial tracing products claim to be able to analyse 100% of requests.
